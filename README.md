Cogs for [Red Discord Bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)  
A collection of cogs I make as bounties on the [cogboard](https://cogboard.red/c/bounties).  
These cogs will not be updated as frequently as my [main repo](https://github.com/Flame442/FlameCogs), however I will try to keep them working with the latest Red update.

# Installation

These are cogs for the [Red Bot V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/develop) so ensure you have a working red bot.

Make sure downloader is loaded

`[p]load downloader`

>[p] is your prefix.

Add this repo using

`[p]repo add flamebountycogs https://github.com/Flame442/FlameBountyCogs`

Then, install each cog individually with

`[p]cog install flamebountycogs <cog name>`

And load each cog with

`[p]load <cog name>`
